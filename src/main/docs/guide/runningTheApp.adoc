At this point a test run is suggested just to make sure everything is functioning properly.

To run the application first

[source,bash]
----
$ cd initial/
----

NOTE: To run the completed app `$ cd complete/` instead of `initial`.

To launch the application, run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew bootRun
----

At this point we have not configured any views so there is nothing to see in our browser
yet but so long as your terminal looks similar to the following and you see that tomcat
was started on 8080 everything should be good.

Now that we have checked the app starts, go ahead and shut it down for now `Ctrl-C`.
