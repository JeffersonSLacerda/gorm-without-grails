Now that all our app config is complete and we should be able to view our tables at
http://localhost:8080/console lets go ahead and bootstrap some data. Since we don't have a
built in bootstraping construct like we do in Grails we make use of a hibernate feature that
allows us to auto import a sql file.

First lets create a new file `import.sql` in `src/main/resources`. Once you have created
the sql file go ahead and edit it and add the following.

[source,sql]
./src/main/resources/import.sql
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/import.sql[]
----

Now as mentioned in the last section make sure that in
your `application.properties` file you have `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create-drop`.
Without that line hibernate will not pickup on your `import.sql` and will not bootstrap
your data.
