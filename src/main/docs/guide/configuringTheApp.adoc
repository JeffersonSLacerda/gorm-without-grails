Since this is Spring Boot and not Grails we have to do a little bit more setup that we
are used to. In your top level project directory create a `gradle.properties` file.

[source,bash]
----
$ touch gradle.properties
----

After you have run the above command your new file should have been created on the same level
as your `build.gradle` file.

Now lets edit your new properties file and add the following to it.

[source,groovy]
./gradle.properties
----
include::{sourceDir}/gradle.properties[indent=0, lines="1..3"]
----

This sets us up for our next step of editing our build config and adding some necessary
dependencies to our project.

NOTE: The necessary dependencies are detailed http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#springBoot[here]
 in the GORM documentation.


[source,groovy]
./build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0, lines="1..43"]
----

<1> We have removed the ext block in favor of using one of our properties in the
`gradle.properties` file we just created.
<2> Apply an IDE specific plugin for IntelliJ since that is what we are using (Not Required).
<3> Add the required dependencies for GORM to our project.
<4> Add additional tomcat dependencies. (Without these the database will not work correctly when running).
<5> Extra testing dependencies so we can use Spock with Spring Boot.
