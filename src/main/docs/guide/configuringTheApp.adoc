Since this is Spring Boot and not Grails we have to do a little bit more setup that we
are used to. In your top level project directory create a `gradle.properties` file.

[source,bash]
----
$ touch gradle.properties
----

After you have created run the above command your new file should be on the same level
as your `build.gradle` file.
