Beyond our simple domain tests getting everything configured properly takes a few extra changes.
If you started with our `initial` app or if you created your own, you will find that you have
a `src/main/resources/application.properties`. Lets go ahead and add some options there.

[source,groovy]
./src/main/resources/application.properties
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.properties[]
----

The last line is required in order to make use of hibernates auto importing feature to
bootstrap data. Without this line being set to `create` or `create-drop` it will not
bootstrap our data (more on this next).

The first 3 lines enable h2 console access in the browser so you can navigate to
http://localhost:8080/console[] and view your database.

Next create an additional `application.yml` in `src/main/resources`. After creation go
ahead and edit the file and add the following.

NOTE: For more information on configuration look at the GORM documentation
http://gorm.grails.org/latest/hibernate/manual/index.html#configuration[here].

[source,groovy]
./src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

The `dataSource` block is what ties your database and GORM together. Without this your
domain tests will pass but if you run the application and go to view your database at
http://localhost:8080/console[] it will always be empty and no tables will be generated.

IMPORTANT: There is a lot going on in these two files so
      pay close attention as these are the connecting glue.
